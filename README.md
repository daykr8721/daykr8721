## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi, I'm Dayana

I work at the intersection of technology, human understanding, and strategic communication.

I'm not a developer — I'm the person who understands *why* something should be built,
*how* it should work, and *how to explain it so that anyone gets it*.

Founder of **The Crossing Studio**, where I connect the human side and the technical side to create solutions that make sense.

## 🔍 What I actually do
- Translate technical complexity into simple, powerful narratives  
- Turn vague problems into structured, solvable challenges  
- Help technical teams communicate the real value of what they build  
- Guide companies through tech adoption  
- Build frameworks, models, and methods to solve real problems  

---

## 🎯 Why I exist in teams
Because most teams have:
- developers who know how to build,  
- managers who know what they want,  
but almost no one who *translates* between these worlds.

I’m that bridge — transforming confusion into clarity and decisions.

- Design Thinking Mastery  
- Elevator Pitch Talent
