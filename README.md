## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi, I'm Dayana

I work at the intersection of technology, human understanding, and strategic communication.

I'm not a developer — I'm the person who understands *why* something should be built,
*how* it should work, and *how to explain it so that anyone gets it*.

Founder of **The Crossing Studio**, where I connect the human side and the technical side to create solutions that make sense.

---

## 🔍 What I actually do
- Translate technical complexity into simple, powerful narratives  
- Turn vague problems into structured, solvable challenges  
- Help technical teams communicate the real value of what they build  
- Guide companies through tech adoption  
- Build frameworks, models, and methods to solve real problems  

---

## 🎯 Why I exist in teams
Because most teams have:
- developers who know how to build,  
- managers who know what they want,  
but almost no one who *translates* between these worlds.

I’m that bridge — transforming confusion into clarity and decisions.

## 🧠 My superpowers
- **Design Thinking Mastery** → I fall in love with problems before creating solutions.  
- **Elevator Pitch Talent** → I can explain your product in 20 seconds in a way your grandmother understands.  
- **Human–Tech Translation** → I speak both languages: logic and emotion, engineering and narrative.  
- **Solution Builder Mindset** → If something doesn’t exist, I build it (tools, frameworks, methods).  
- **Tech Understanding** → Learning to develop to better navigate tech adoption from the inside.

## 🛠️ What you'll find here
- Frameworks for problem framing  
- Templates for requirement gathering  
- Methods for tech adoption  
- Experiments with code  
- Real cases of human–tech translation
